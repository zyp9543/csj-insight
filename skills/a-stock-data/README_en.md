Full-stack data toolkit for China A-Share market — 10-layer architecture · 47 endpoints (44 primary + 3 official backups) · 15 data sources · zero third-party data wrapper dependencies

A self-contained Skill file that consolidates raw A-share data from 15 sources into a ready-to-use toolkit for AI coding assistants. No need to memorize mootdx candlestick parameters, Eastmoney PDF Referer headers, or iwencai X-Claw authentication — it's all handled. And when a primary source bans you, there's a backup-source quick reference to fall back on.

> Compatible with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) · [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) · [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw)
>
> The Skill file is structured Markdown + embedded Python. Any AI coding assistant with context injection can use it.

## Architecture

```
China A-Share Full-Stack Data · 10-Layer Architecture · V3.6.1
│  (Priority: prefer mootdx/Tencent — never IP-banned; Eastmoney only for exclusive data, with built-in throttling)
├── Market Data    mootdx + Tencent + Baidu K-line   Candlesticks (w/ MA5/10/20) + Order Book + PE/PB + Index/ETF
├── Research       Eastmoney + THS + iwencai          Stock reports / Industry reports / PDF / Consensus EPS / NL search
├── Signals        THS + Eastmoney                    Hot stocks + Sector attribution + Northbound flow
│                                                     + Sector membership + Fund flow(push2) + Dragon Tiger + Lockup + Industry + Board fund flow
├── Capital Flow   Eastmoney datacenter + push2       Margin trading + Block trades + Holder count + Dividends + Fund flow(min+120d)
├── News           Eastmoney + Cailianpress           Stock news / CLS flash (✅revived in V3.4) / Global finance (mutual backup)
├── Fundamentals   mootdx + Eastmoney + Sina          37-field quarterly + F10 9 categories + Financial statements
├── Filings        cninfo + mootdx                    Full filings across SSE / SZSE / BSE
├── Limit-Up       Eastmoney push2ex + THS            ZT/ZB/DT/prev-ZT pools / limit reasons / consecutive-board ladder
│                                                     + Watch list pool + Intraday price-anomaly pool  ★V3.6
├── Options        Sina hq.sinajs                     ETF option T-quotes / Greeks / implied volatility  ★V3.3
└── Sentiment      cninfo IRM + THS + Eastmoney       Investor Q&A / hot lists / popularity rank / concept hits  ★V3.3
```

> ★V3.4 On top of the 10 layers there is now a **Backup Sources & Fallback Strategy** appendix: SSE/SZSE official + Sina + HKEX — official backup functions (dragon-tiger / fund flow / filings) + a per-layer fallback table for when a primary source bans you (see the corresponding SKILL.md section).

## Quick Start

**3 steps, 2 minutes.**

```bash
# 1. Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data

# 2. Download SKILL.md
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonlin1212/a-stock-data/main/SKILL.md

# 3. Install dependencies (V3.0: akshare no longer needed)
pip install mootdx requests pandas stockstats
```

Launch Claude Code and say "Check the valuation of 688017" — the skill activates automatically.

> **Codex / OpenClaw users:** Paste the contents of SKILL.md into your system prompt or project context file. The embedded Python code is ready to execute.

## 47 Endpoints

> **Counting convention:** the tables below have 48 rows but count as 47 endpoints — "Eastmoney Industry Reports" shares **the same endpoint** as "Eastmoney reportapi" (only the `qType` parameter differs) and "THS Northbound (historical)" is a local self-built cache (not a separate endpoint), so neither is counted; the single "EM Intraday Anomaly Pool" row covers **two** endpoints (`list` / `count`), adding one back. 48 − 1 − 1 + 1 = 47.

## Data Source Priority (V3.2 re-ranked by IP-ban risk)

> **Principle: anything available from mootdx or Tencent (quotes / K-line / live price / market cap / financials) must use them first (never IP-banned). Eastmoney is only for its exclusive data, all routed through the throttled `em_get()`.**

| Priority | Source | Protocol | IP Ban Risk | Use |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-----|
| **1 (top)** | mootdx (TDX) | TCP 7709 | **Never banned** | K-line / order book / ticks / financials / F10 |
| **2 (top)** | Tencent Finance | HTTP | **Never banned** | Live price / PE / PB / market cap / turnover / index / ETF |
| 3 | THS Hot Stocks / Northbound | HTTP | Very low (zero auth) | Hot stocks / themes / northbound flow |
| 4 | Baidu Finance | HTTP | Very low | K-line (w/ MA5/10/20) |
| 5 | Sina Finance | HTTP | Low | Financial statements |
| 6 | cninfo | HTTP | Low | Filings |
| 7 | THS Consensus EPS | HTTP | Low (UA required) | Consensus EPS |
| 8 | iwencai | OpenAPI | Low (key required) | NL semantic search |
| **last (exclusive only)** | **Eastmoney** datacenter/push2/reportapi/search/np-weblist | HTTP | **Medium — has rate-limit risk** | Dragon-tiger / lockup / margin / block trade / shareholders / dividends / fund flow / reports / news (all via `em_get()`) |

> **Architecture:** Except mootdx (TCP binary protocol), all sources use direct HTTP API calls, zero third-party data wrapper dependencies. **Eastmoney APIs are rate-limited; all calls go through `em_get()` for serial throttling. For batch jobs, increase `EM_MIN_INTERVAL`.**
>
> **Fallback (V3.4 new):** When any primary source is banned or broken, check the "Backup Sources & Fallback Strategy" section in SKILL.md — every data category has an independent backup on a **different domain and rate-limit plane** (SSE/SZSE official / Sina / THS / HKEX), unaffected when Eastmoney bans you.
