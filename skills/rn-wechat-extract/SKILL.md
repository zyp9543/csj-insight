# RN WeChat Extract

Extract the full text of a WeChat public account article into clean Markdown.

This skill is a **source reader** — it extracts and returns text. It does not summarize, rewrite, translate, or produce video.

## How It Works

WeChat blocks external access to public account articles through User-Agent detection: the server checks for the `MicroMessenger` keyword and rejects normal browser requests.

This skill sends HTTP requests with a genuine WeChat iOS WebView User-Agent and the correct Referer header, which is sufficient to receive the full article HTML. No login, cookie, or API key is needed.

**Extracts:** title, author, publish time, and body text as Markdown.

**Limitations:**
- Images are not downloaded (WeChat uses lazy-loaded `data-src`)
- Some heavily JS-rendered articles may return partial content
- Rapid successive calls from the same IP may trigger CAPTCHA (wait and retry)
- Does not work on login-gated or paid articles

## Locate The Skill

```bash
WX_HOME="$(
  for d in "$(pwd)/.codex/skills/rn-wechat-extract" \
           "$(pwd)/.agents/skills/rn-wechat-extract" \
           "$(pwd)/.claude/skills/rn-wechat-extract" \
           "$(pwd)/rnskill/skills/rn-wechat-extract" \
           "$HOME/.codex/skills/rn-wechat-extract" \
           "$HOME/.agents/skills/rn-wechat-extract" \
           "$HOME/.claude/skills/rn-wechat-extract"; do
    [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] && echo "$d" && break
  done
)"
export WX_HOME
```

## Workflow

1. Health check (optional):

   ```bash
   python3 "$WX_HOME/scripts/fetch_wechat.py" --doctor
   ```

2. Extract article:

   ```bash
   python3 "$WX_HOME/scripts/fetch_wechat.py" "<mp.weixin.qq.com URL>" \
     --output-dir "<desired output directory>"
   ```

3. The script prints a JSON result to stdout:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "title": "文章标题",
     "author": "公众号名称",
     "publish_time": "2026-07-14 00:18",
     "char_count": 7025,
     "output_path": "path/to/extracted.md"
   }
   ```

4. Read the output file and present the full text or pass it to the next skill.

5. On failure:
   - Exit 1 (fetch/CAPTCHA): suggest retry after a few minutes or ask the user to paste text
   - Exit 2 (parse failure): rerun with `--raw` to save HTML for debugging

## Command Reference

```
fetch_wechat.py <url> [options]

Arguments:
  url                    mp.weixin.qq.com article URL

Options:
  --output-dir <dir>     Output directory (default: current directory)
  --raw                  Also save the raw HTML alongside the Markdown
  --doctor               Check dependencies and exit
```

No external dependencies — Python stdlib only (`urllib`, `re`, `html`, `json`).

## Integration Examples

This skill provides text for any downstream content workflow:

| Scenario | Call chain |
|---|---|
| Rewrite article into video script | rn-wechat-extract → rewrite skill |
| Save article as topic idea | rn-wechat-extract → topic management |
| Read and discuss an article | rn-wechat-extract (standalone) |
| Turn article into image cards | rn-wechat-extract → content adaptation |
